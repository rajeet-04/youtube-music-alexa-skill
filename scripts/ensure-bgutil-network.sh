# Idempotently attach the bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider container to the "web"
# Docker network so ytmusic (which shares gluetun's network namespace, and
# gluetun is on "web") can reach it at http://bgutil-provider:4416.
#
# bgutil-provider is a standalone container (not part of this repo's
# docker-compose.yml -- see README) started separately on this host with
# --restart unless-stopped, bound only to 127.0.0.1:4416 on the host. That
# loopback binding is not reachable from ytmusic's network namespace, so it
# also needs a second interface on the "web" network. `docker network
# connect` is a live, in-memory attachment: it is lost if bgutil-provider (or
# the "web" network itself) is ever removed and recreated, so this script
# re-applies it and is safe to run any number of times.
#
# Run manually after recreating bgutil-provider, or install the accompanying
# systemd unit (see ensure-bgutil-network.service) to retry while the Docker
# network/provider is unavailable and re-check on each later unit start.
